The Final Project: A memory game!

View me in RAW in order for clarification

We'll need:

A highscore display >> must be in a scores.txt file

difficulty that affects card amount

1 - 4 cards
2 - 16 cards?
3 - 32 cards?

possible workaround for not repeating items in table/ displaying items in the table.

on backend have an array that keeps track of matches until all values in array match or are more than 0.

EX: BACKEND

   [!][@]   [1][0]

   [@][!]   [0][1]
   
What is displayed to player:

   [!][ ]
   
   [ ][!]
